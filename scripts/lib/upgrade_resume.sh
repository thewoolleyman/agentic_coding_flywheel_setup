# ACFS Ubuntu Upgrade Resume Script
#
# This script is copied to /var/lib/acfs/ and executed after
# each reboot during the Ubuntu upgrade process.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Source libraries from /var/lib/acfs/lib/
# 2. Mark resume in state
# 3. Check if more upgrades needed
# 4. If complete: cleanup and launch continue_install.sh
# 5. If not complete: run next upgrade and trigger reboot
#
# This script is designed to be run by systemd on boot.
